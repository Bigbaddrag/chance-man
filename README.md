# ChanceMan

## Overview

**Chance Man** is a RuneLite plugin that locks tradeable items until they are unlocked by a random roll. Designed for players who enjoy adding extra randomness or progression to their gameplay, Chance Man provides a unique system for ‚Äúearning‚Äù items through luck. Items become accessible only after you roll to unlock them, with progress saved per player across sessions.

## Features

- **Locking Mechanic**
    - Tradeable items (excluding coins) start out locked.
    - Items remain locked until you perform a successful roll to unlock them.
    - Prevents locked items from being picked up, equipped, or otherwise used until they are rolled.

- **Rolling System**
    - Roll animations determine which item gets unlocked.
    - The final rolled item is announced via chat messages and automatically becomes unlocked.
    - A dedicated panel button (‚ÄúRoll‚Äù) lets you manually trigger a roll if you have locked items.

- **Ground Item & Inventory Detection**
    - Automatically rolls when you encounter locked items on the ground or receive them in your inventory (e.g., quest rewards).
    - Rolls each item only once, so repeated drops of the same item type won‚Äôt trigger multiple rolls.

- **Show Drops Menu**
    - Right-click an NPC and choose **Show Drops** to fetch its drop table from the wiki.
    - The Music tab displays icons and a progress bar for the NPC's drops, and hovering an icon shows its name.

- **Rolled & Unlocked Panels**
    - A **Rolled Items** section logs every item that has triggered a roll.
    - An **Unlocked Items** section shows which items have been successfully unlocked.
    - Both panels maintain descending order so the most recent items appear at the top.
    - A search bar lets you quickly find items.
    - The üîÑ button swaps between Rolled and Unlocked views.
    - Filter toggles show only unlocked‚Äënot‚Äërolled or both unlocked‚Äëand‚Äërolled items.
    - The Discord icon links to the community server for help and discussion and good vibes.

- **Persistence**
    - Each player‚Äôs rolled/unlocked data is stored locally in JSON files, ensuring you don‚Äôt lose progress between sessions.
    - Data is automatically saved and loaded for each character name.

- **Grand Exchange Search Filtering**
    - Locked items are hidden in GE search results and dimmed until you unlock them

## Configuration

Open RuneLite‚Äôs plugin settings and select **ChanceMan** to adjust these options:

- **Free To Play Mode** ‚Äì Only roll items available to F2P players.
- **Include F2P trade-only items** ‚Äì With F2P mode enabled, also roll items that normally require trading to obtain.
- **Roll Item Sets** ‚Äì Include item set pieces in the pool of rollable items.
- **Roll Flatpacks** ‚Äì Let flatpacks appear in rolls.

## Usage

1. **Start the Plugin**
    - Enable **ChanceMan** in the RuneLite plugin list.
    - The plugin automatically scans for tradeable items (excluding coins) and locks them until a roll occurs.

2. **Encountering Locked Items**
    - When you see a locked item on the ground or receive it in your inventory, ChanceMan will prompt a roll if it hasn‚Äôt already been rolled.
    - The item remains locked until the roll animation completes and it‚Äôs unlocked.

3. **Manual Rolls**
    - Use the **Roll** button in the ChanceMan panel to manually trigger a roll for a random locked item if you have any remaining locked items.
    - A spinning animation appears in an overlay, revealing the unlocked item at the end.

4. **Viewing Progress**
    - Open the **ChanceMan** side panel to see the **Rolled Items** and **Unlocked Items** columns.
    - The **Rolled Items** list tracks which items have triggered a roll.
    - The **Unlocked Items** list displays items that are fully unlocked for use.

5. **Restrictions**
    - While locked, items cannot be used, eaten, equipped, or otherwise interacted with (except ‚Äúexamine‚Äù and ‚Äúdrop‚Äù).
    - Once unlocked, they function as normal items.

## File Locations

- **Unlocked Items**  
  `~/.runelite/chanceman/<player_name>/chanceman_unlocked.json`
- **Rolled Items**  
  `~/.runelite/chanceman/<player_name>/chanceman_rolled.json`

These JSON files store your progress. Each player‚Äôs data is kept in a separate folder named after their in-game character name.
